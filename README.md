# country-api-app-react-native
This is a demo project to learn react native in a better way with axius 

This project is about dispalying the countries by the provided API which is: https://restcountries.com/

The libraries that ı used for this project:

- React Native Navigation 
- Axios ( for the apı requests )
- I also used a third party component which is dynamic-search-bar (https://github.com/WrathChaos/react-native-dynamic-search-bar)

I tried to use hooks and props in most efficient way with the right component tree.
